# Qt t:slim X2 Pump Simulation  

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to develop an **interactive software simulation** of the **t:slim X2 insulin pump** using **Qt/C++**. This simulation will:  
- Replicate **essential pump functions**  
- Enable the **recording and visualization** of usage metrics  
- Incorporate algorithms to **analyze weekly patient data** for actionable insights into **glucose control**  
- Emphasize **comprehensive unit testing** and **GUI-based testing** for high software quality  

### Why This Matters  
In todayâ€™s rapidly advancing healthcare landscape, **virtual medical device simulations** act as an essential bridge between **theoretical knowledge and practical application**. By emulating the operation of sophisticated medical equipment in a **controlled and risk-free environment**, these tools:  
- Provide users with **valuable hands-on experience**  
- Eliminate the need for **direct access to physical devices**  
- Enhance **skill development and safety**  
- Build **greater confidence and understanding** in the use of advanced medical technologies  

The **Tandem t:slim X2 Insulin Pump** is designed to **deliver precise insulin dosages** for effective **diabetes management**. Our simulation aims to **closely mimic** its behavior to offer both **educational and analytical benefits**.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Qt 6** (for GUI and application logic)  
- **C++** (for core functionality)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:
